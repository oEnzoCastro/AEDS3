## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `database`: the folder to maintain databases
- `DAO`: the folder to access the database
- `models`: the folder to maintain objects
- `services`: the folder to maintain program functions
  
- `App.java`: the Main file

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
